*My video medallion as a team lead - unfortunately, only in Czech* -->

<!-- Link with word -->
<!-- As the company's principles of work were facing towards the goal of becoming a [Teal Organization](https://workology.com/what-is-a-teal-organization/) with holocratic principles, my role as a team leader was **more representative and strategic than managerial** as the right to make decisions was always in the hands of the whole team. The role was **focused mainly on leadership and facilitating all information flow** - in other words: ensuring that everyone was informed of everything they needed to and providing context for any decisions that had to be made. -->
