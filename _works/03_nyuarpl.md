As a Robotics Research Scientist at the NYU ARPL, my role involves being a key contributor to the UAV Autonomy pipeline, especially in Perception, Planning and SLAM. I work closely with a team of talented researchers, engineers, and scientists to advance the state-of-the-art in robotics technologies. The lab's primary focus is on developing autonomous and agile UAVs for a variety of applications. Working at NYU ARPL has been a rewarding experience. I have contributed to several successful projects that have pushed the boundaries. 

Responsibilities and Accomplishments:

1. **Autonomous UAV Pipeline Development in ROS2:**  
    As a new joinee to lab my first responsibility was to collaborate with team of PhD researchers and develope a UAV Autonomy pipeline in ROS2 C++. This pipeline consist implementation of quadrotor geometric controller, a RVIZ based simulation, trajectory generation module and trajectory tracking algorithm. Along with this, I also developed a ROS2 based VICON tracking and localizing package.  

2. **Modification & Deployment of OpenVINS VIO on UAV platform:**  
    The lab's UAV RACE platform required a robust Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) algorithm to handle platform vibrations and feature loss effectively. To meet this requirement, we customized the open-source VIO algorithm, OpenVINS, optimizing it for our specific use case. The modified algorithm was then deployed on NVIDIA Jetson boards as part of the UAV Autonomy pipeline. This deployment efficiently utilized approximately 70% of the board's computation power, ensuring reliable and precise performance during UAV operations.

3. **UAV Autonomy Pipeline for NIST UAS First Responder Challenge:**  
    As an integral aspect of ensuring real-world compatibility for our RACE platform, our lab participated in the esteemed NIST UAS First Responder Challenge. I assumed a role in engineering a customized UAV autonomy pipeline that addressed the competition's specific requirements, encompassing aspects such as localization, mapping, control, GUI, and navigation. This bespoke pipeline played a vital role in NYU's participation in the NIST UAV First Responder Challenge, setting our team apart as one of the few with its autonomous stack, a remarkable achievement in this prestigious competition.

<!-- As the company's principles of work were facing towards the goal of becoming a [Teal Organization](https://workology.com/what-is-a-teal-organization/) with holocratic principles, my role as a team leader was **more representative and strategic than managerial** as the right to make decisions was always in the hands of the whole team. The role was **focused mainly on leadership and facilitating all information flow** - in other words: ensuring that everyone was informed of everything they needed to and providing context for any decisions that had to be made. -->
