<!-- At COAST Autonomous, I worked as a Robotics Engineer Intern, contributing my skills and knowledge to the development of cutting-edge technologies in the field of autonomous vehicles. This internship provided me with valuable industry experience and the opportunity to work on exciting projects in a fast-paced and dynamic environment. 

Key Responsibilities and Achievements:

1. **Trajectory Prediction of Surrounding Traffic Agents:**  
    In urban and densely populated areas, particularly with a high volume of traffic agents, navigating an Autonomous Vehicle (AV) becomes a challenging task. The presence of these dynamic traffic agents in the vicinity of the AV complicates trajectory planning. To address this issue, predicting the motion of these traffic agents proves to be a viable solution, instilling confidence in trajectory generation for future planning and ensuring a smooth ride. Employing a novel RNN-LSTM seq-to-seq based architecture, we developed a trajectory prediction model for traffic agents with an impressive 80% accuracy. The model was built from scratch, using the last 5 sequence of positions for each agent to accurately predict the subsequent 5 sequences with an 80% success rate. 

2. **Semantic Segmentation based Driving space detection:**  
    Navigating autonomous vehicles in rural and construction areas with limited or no proper lanes presents a significant challenge. To tackle this issue, I focused on harnessing the power of deep learning by training a cutting-edge DeepLabV3 segmentation model using the Cityscape dataset. This state-of-the-art approach allowed the model to accurately distinguish drivable spaces from obstacles, enhancing the vehicles' perception capabilities significantly. As a result, our implementation contributed to safer and more efficient navigation for autonomous vehicles, particularly in complex and challenging environments where conventional methods fall short. -->
